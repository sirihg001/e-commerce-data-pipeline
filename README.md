## Inventory Optimization Data Pipeline – GlobalShop
### Overview
This project presents a scalable data engineering pipeline designed to optimize inventory management for an e-commerce company, GlobalShop. The pipeline integrates ETL processes, predictive modeling, and cloud-based solutions to enhance inventory efficiency, reduce storage costs, and improve product availability.

### Objective
To develop a data-driven solution that predicts product demand, optimizes restocking strategies, and minimizes overstocking/understocking issues, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.

### Technologies Used
Programming: Python, SQL
Big Data Processing: Apache Spark
ETL & Data Engineering: Pandas, NumPy, Apache Airflow
Cloud & Storage: AWS S3, Azure Data Lake
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Time Series Forecasting
Databases: PostgreSQL, Snowflake
Pipeline Architecture
Data Ingestion: Extracting sales, inventory, and supplier data from multiple sources.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and preparing it for analysis.
Predictive Modeling: Implementing time-series forecasting to optimize restocking.
Cloud Integration: Storing and processing large datasets using AWS/Azure.
Automation & Monitoring: Using Apache Airflow to schedule, track, and optimize pipeline workflows.
Key Features
✔ Automated ETL pipeline for efficient data processing.
✔ Real-time inventory optimization using demand forecasting models.
